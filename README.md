## Game Description
### Board

The board is an NxN squared board, where N is an odd number between 11 and 19. The board has a checkered pattern of black and white spaces, with the four corners all being white. The board starts off empty.

### Gameplay
The players are Black and White, with Black going first. Each has a supply of stones in their color.

On each turn, a player can take one of the following actions:

- Drop a stone of their color onto a black square - a stone may never be placed in a white square.
- Shift a stone of their color already on a board, in a black square, to an adjacent white square.

The winner is the first player to get five of their stones in a row horizontally or vertically, or four stones in row diagonally on white spaces. Stones on black spaces cannot win with a diagonal line.

Optional rules:
- To mitigate Black's advantage first move advantage, the players may agree to prohibit Black from winning with the easier B-W-B-W-B orthogonal line and force him to win only with the harder W-B-W-B-W orthogonal line
